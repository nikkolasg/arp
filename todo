    -for now checking is basic, implement checking braodcast address 
    -arp one way only, router still sends results back directly to victim
and not to us !!

--> working with bridge ;)
--> Switch : either flood switch arp table,
             or MitM attack. (better ;)

tool design == ?
    -> Goal of arp spoofing attacks : sniff & intercept traffic (with/out modification)
    -> scenarios : 
            -> sniff host on network : flood switch or MitM attack on host and router
            -> intercept traffic :MitM on host and router / other .
                                 if redirection == sniffing + modification
                                   Else : Dos ;) network unusable by host


    ==> methods :
        -arp_flooding : will flood the network (though the switch, mostly)
                        until switch arp's table is filled and it goes
                        "broadcast" mode, then we can sniff.
                        flood for example all MAC address are its own.
                        ->frequency : fast, like 1 sec
        -arp_mitm: host A & B. will flood A & B with spoofed arp packets
                        -> frequency : fast at first, for 10 packets let's say, then at 30 sec intervals


    ==> flow :
        - initialisation (options, pcap init etc)
        - flooding/spoofing



organisation :
    main -> main launcher + options parsing
    flood -> flood operation. 
    mitm -> mitm attack
    network + gateway -> network miscellaneous routines
    pcap -> pcap routines
    arp necessary ? No
    packet_print / struct -> you know.

    ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    pcap routines must accept function pointers to call in certain cases or in all cases i.e. set_ip_callback, set_arp_callback, or set_pkt_callback 
    MAJOR CHANGES : no need to LISTEN packets. Only injecting will be done. sniffing can be done much better with wireshark.
